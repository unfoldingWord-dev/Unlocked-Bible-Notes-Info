The UBN's Relationship to the Unlocked Bible Commentary (UBC)
=============

The Unlocked Bible Notes and the Unlocked Bible Commentary are projects meant to be developed simultaneously, so it is important for all who are writing either notes or commentary material to understand both projects to some extent.

The UBN is meant to serve the needs of both beginning Christians (and even interested unbelievers) and advanced Christians, especially those having teaching or pastoral responsibility. Because of their brevity, these notes are meant to provide rapid boosts of comprehension, in a manner similar to the study Bible notes that many American Christians use.

The UBC is planned, on the other hand, to address needs of pastors and other church workers for deepening their understanding of the biblical texts. The UBC, unlike the UBN, will meet interpretative needs are deeper than what the UBN can can meet.
