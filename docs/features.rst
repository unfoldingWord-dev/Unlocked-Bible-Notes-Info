The main features of the UBN
============================

The UBN is to have these main features:

Basic-level and advanced-level notes
------------------------------------

Notes are to be either basic-level or advanced-level. Basic-level notes are to be suitable for any individual with minimal biblical experience. Advanced-level notes are to be suitable for meeting the need for deeper information, of the kind required by Bible teachers, pastors, and the like. Advanced notes are to be given the following tag: #adv, while basic notes are to be left untagged.

There is a limit of 30 words to basic-level notes and 90 words to advanced-level notes.

Version-Free Notes
------------------

The notes are not to be tied to any one version of Scripture, because they are to be translated and adapted into other languages. This means that the notes are not to cite any one version's rendering of passages. Instead, the notes must refer to ideas in the passages (see Section 6.1).

When versions adopt conflicting interpretations of a passage, the note should present the conflict in a reasonable fashion, without taking sides. A note can, of course, point out any conceptual ramifications of particular interpretations. 

Glossary and Articles as Accompanying Resources
------------------------------------------------

Two features that are meant to accompany both the UBN and UBC are a glossary of important words in the Scriptures and a set of articles explaining matters necessary for background understanding of the Bible.

The glossary is to be composed of entries with short, 30-word maximum explanations, descriptions, and definitions. The glossary entries are meant to be an efficient way to communicate important ideas that frequently appear in the Scriptures. Nevertheless, remember that the meanings of terms are set forth in the glossary often require modification in the context of any given biblical passage. This means that notes will frequently have to present such modification.

The articles are to be longer presentations of concepts found in the Scriptures, where short glossary entries are insufficient. The articles are to have a 150-word maximum. 

The notes are to have links to the glossary entries and articles. Also, glossary entries can have links to each other and to articles.

The Paragraphing Characteristics of the Notes
----------------------------------------------







Ease of Adaptation and Translation into other Languages
--------------------------------------------------------

The UBN notes are meant to be freely adapted and translated into other languages. This means that:

1. The English UBN notes are not meant to be so much a package of notes to be translated as a template for notes to be created in another language. Some English notes will not be judged as necessary in various other cultures of the world, while those same cultures may require certain notes not appearing in the English UBN.

2. For notes to have the greatest ease of translation, they must have the least amount possible of English idiomatic expressions. They should also read clearly and easily. We will try to provide guidelines in an appendix for translation-friendly writing.
